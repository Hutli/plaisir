I won her heart above all others,
We have no problems no risk no bothers.
The perfect marriage for all to show,
It is these days that kills me slow.

The corn stands solumn in the field,
This summer will bring decent yeild.
Not much to do after we sow,
It is these days that kills me slow.

The competition at perfect speed,
Not much to fight for or compeed.
The land is peacefull with quiet flow,
It is these days that kills me slow.

The scholars mill around the place,
The halls so quiet full of space.
Young folks laugh from rooms below,
It is these days that kills me slow.

One of the pictures was by many declared the perfect picture. It was of a calm lake perfectly mirroring a peacefully towering snow-capped mountains. Overheard was a blue clear sky with fluffy clouds.

However, you did not agree, you found the perfect picture instead. In it, the sky looked very angry, there were lightning. This did not look peaceful at all. It looked like the artist has mistakenly submitted his painting depicting storm. However,  closely at the painting, and saw a tiny bush growing in the cracks in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. In the midst of the rush of angry weather, the bird sat on her nest with peace. You declared this picture the winner. To the tune of peace.
