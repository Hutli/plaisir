\section*{The Disappearance of Daniel Kordes}
People have started vanishing in the Druga Ville, the second settlement of the new world. The undercover agent Daniel Kordes was sent to investigate however he disappeared shortly after his arrival. 

\subsection*{The Arrival}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The group arrives in the evening to the town
    \item The party hears a scream in a nearby alley and Pete runs after it 
    \item Niclas's see a small creatures scurrying down the well
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When they arrive they meet a young woman who just had her child stolen by two devilish creatures!
        \item They see the tail of one creature rounding a corner, chase begins if they run after it
        \item The creatures are two Redcaps
        \item If they are caught, go to \nameref{subadv:the_redcaps}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He runs after it, behind the group. As he is looking over the edge of the well he is knocked on the head and quickly kidnapped into one of the dark alleys.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Most people they ask in town will point them towards the Huntsman when they ask for knowledge of devils or underground
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Huntsman}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When they arrive at his house they see a furious man currently in the process of destroying his own house
    \item He knows that these devils are Imps and that they come up from the well at night to spy
        He has not yet succeeded in catching one, as they are fierce creatures but he can help lay a trap as they leave during the night, it will not be enough to hold them, but it will give the party advanced warning and can hold it back shortly so they can jump it
    If the party wants to go into the well to attack them directly he knows a way in down by the river that leads in there
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Redcaps}
\label{subadv:the_redcaps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the group successfully catches one of the Redcaps they can interrogate it 
    \item A social skill check about the reason why the Imps are here can revile:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  10-14: They come to prey on the city since they feel the nice tasty magic that is being performed here
        \item 16-19: They tell that somebody is performing powerful and naughty rituals, somewhere down below - Haven't found it yet! - The people are calling it the Third Eye, such a fantastic smell!
        \item 20+: They give the group the key they have stolen from one of the people who was emanating this fantastic aura!
    \end{itemize}
    \item If the group kills the imps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investigation check of 15+ also reviles the key
    \end{itemize}
    \item The key is engraved with the mark of The Third Eye
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Inn}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Innkeeper does not remember anyone named Daniel Kordes
    \item The Inn has a guest book, but people come and go all the time so the Inn has been so busy that the book was filled within three week, and was thrown out two days ago

            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item One of the regulars at the bar remembers that a barmaid was talking quite extensively with the - If the party is being obnoxious enough, or gives another incentive he may speak up
    \item A barmaid checked Daniel Kordes into his room. They flirted for quite some time (annoying all other customers that needed to check in) - All staff (except the owner and his wife) is off for the rest of the week

        \item She does not want to speak, in fear of getting into trouble, but he does remember a logo on the pouch the man retrieved the reward from
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Strange Man}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tomisław Polinski - A bit looney, but surprisingly, the man closest to the truth
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He has put traps and riddles on his house, that is likely to trigger if the party tries to enter without permission
    \end{itemize}
    \item He has seen the symbols on some of the paperwork he has stolen between the black rider and the Maison de
    \item He knows that the black rider and some people that looks like they are working for him has access to the Maison
    \item He has not seen them do it but he is certain that some people has entered the town and never left again and that they are behind it!
    \item He has never seen them enter the building, only go out the back and down by the river

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Man on a black horse}
\begin{itemize}

    \item He also made sure that the metal could be polished into a mirror
    \item He also bought a very large bag of wall-mounts which he filled into a bag of holding
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Barmaid}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Louise Piaget
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is tough to convince the family to let the group talk with the barmaid (DC 17)

        \item The barmaid noticed that when they met to say goodbye, he had not yet packed 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item He told her to never try to find her again and gave her a piece of paper with a symbol drawn on it. If she ever saw that, she should get as far away as possible!
            \item (If the group seems lost she could have followed him and seen the same as the strange man)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Return}
\nameref{char:isabelle_kulinska} knows that a secret organization have been given permission to work out of the curch. The contract has her symbol on it. Somewhere deep down she probably knows that this is the best explanation to why people keep disappearing but doesn't want to admit it to herself, and diffidently not the party. If the party does not have anything to negotiate with, she will send them on second mission.
